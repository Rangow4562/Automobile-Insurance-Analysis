PROBLEM STATEMENT / AIM
The objective of this project is the prediction of Customer Life-time Value (CLV). CLV is the lifetime value of a customer, or in other words it represents the total amount of money a customer is expected to spend in business, or on products, during their lifetime. CLV is an important metric because it provides the business groups with a customer-centric perspective to guide some critical marketing and sales strategies, thereby enhancing important business decisions.
